            "description": "This molly lineup is useful for clearing out the box on the right side of Mid Top. To do this, follow the lineup exactly as you see it on-screen, jump, and then throw the molly at the top of the jump. Keep in mind that if your crosshair is even a little too high or too low the molly may go too far or land in a spot that won't do as much damage to players behind the box."
