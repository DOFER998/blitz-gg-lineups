If no enemy players rotate through this area of the map, you may even be able to flank the enemy team later in the round, after your team has taken control of one of the Sites. Be sure to ask your teammates to use smokes and other utility to limit what enemy players can do in areas in Mid that the Defenders may spot you from, and attempt to control the enemy team's information in Mid."
