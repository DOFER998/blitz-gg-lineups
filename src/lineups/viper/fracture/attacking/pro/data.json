The Viper's Pit creates a one way around lower A Site that can potentially make it much more difficult for players to take control of A Site - especially if the enemy team has already had players picked off that would be helpful to clear out under lower A Site to counter the one way.

However, this is somewhat difficult to pull off, so if you are using this in a game for the first time - aim a very small amount to the left of the edge of the b tower platform that overlooks Arcade. Aiming to the left a small amount will give players more room to peek out of Tower, but it is better than not lining up the wall correctly and not blocking players vision in Tower at all. "
