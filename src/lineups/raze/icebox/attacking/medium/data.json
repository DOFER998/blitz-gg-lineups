            "description": "This lineup is useful to know if you want to guarantee that a grenade lands on top of Mid Boiler, but it does come with some risk, and you need a teammate to at least Smoke off Mid to make this work. This is somewhat easily counterable though, since enemy players can somewhat easily see where you threw the grenade from and shoot where they think you are through the smoke."
