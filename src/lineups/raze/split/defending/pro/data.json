            "description": "This double blast pack boost is useful for taking mid bottom control quickly, at several different stages of the round, to either get picks or just stop rotations though that area. To do this, put the first blast pack on the center of the 2nd step going up into mid mail, jump at the angle on screen and detonate it so that you go quickly/far horizontally, then glide above the base of the mid top stairs, throw the second blast pack, and then glide toward the top of the frog."
